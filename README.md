# NextJS Base Project for AntDesign

This is my base project for React and AntDesign based applications. 

In this demonstration case, there is a fixed api configured to return some default values. Default values like a login confirmation or values to employees CRUD.

Still have some improvements to do like components test and build more flexible and iterable selects and autocompletes. 

It's extremely recommended to read about design values and principles on Ant Design website: https://ant.design/docs/spec/values
